# Create dotnet certification for HTTPS

Using the CLI to run your .NET application could produce an error if that application attempts to run with HTTPS and now SSL certificate is provided. In your development environment, run this command:

```
dotnet dev-certs https
```

 - Note: I ran this from the root directory of my project.
